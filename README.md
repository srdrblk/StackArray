# StackArray
 2.   Tek bir dizi içerisinde, 3 tane stack tutmak isterseniz, bunu nasıl yaparsınız? 

README
Stacks are arrays that operate with the LIFO logic. Although it is generally preferred to use with pointers, the use of pointers in Java will not be possible due to Garbage Collector.

In this example, we create an object called stack(stack.java) and create an array of this object type.
As a result, we have a stack array that is compatible with LIFO logic.
